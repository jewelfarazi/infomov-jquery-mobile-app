# infomov-jquery-mobile-app
"InfoMov" is a mobile app based on jquery mobile which can be used as a native android and ios app. This full functional codes will easily work with Apache Cordova and other HTML5/JavaScript based mobile frameworks. To install Apache Cordova on windows checkout my post here http://jewelfarazi.me/installing-cordova-with-android-studio-on-windows/.

## Usage (Apache Cordova)
Just copy all files to 'www' folder inside your Cordova project. Change related xml texts on Cordova app config files. 

Besides Cordova it will perfectly work with your web browser as well :)
